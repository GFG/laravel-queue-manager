### Generating a job

You need generate a class that extends LaravelQueueManager\AbstractJob.

It's necessary to implement 2 methods:

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| getName() | The name of the job |
| execute() | The code of the job yourself |

### Dispatching a new job
You need create a new instance of your job and call the dispatch() method. 

Or use the CLI:
```bash
$ php artisan queue-manager:generate-queue queue_name
```

You can set optional params too:
```bash
$ php artisan queue-manager:generate-queue queue_name foo=test,bar=test
```

### Database

To the job work correctly, it is necessary generate a row in the queue_config table.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| name | It's the same of the return of the getName() method. |
| class_name | The full path with namespace of your job class (\App\Jobs\TestJob) |
| active | If the job is active or not |
| schedulable | If the job is schedulable or not |
| schedule_config | A JSON config of the schedule. {"method" : "The schedule methods from laravel", "params": "The params to the schedule method (optional)"}|
| max_attemps | The max attempts of the queue |
| max_instances | The max parallel instances of the queue |
| timeout | The timeout of the queue |
| delay | The delay to the next execution (Not implemented yet) |
| connection | The connection name of the queue provider. (If null = default)

### Config

At the queue_manager.php config file you can configure:

| Field | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| artisan_path | The artisan path | base_path('artisan') |
| log_path | The log path | storage_path('logs/worker.log') |
| supervisor_config_file | The supervisor config file | /etc/supervisor/conf.d/laravel-queue.conf |
| supervisor_bin | The supervisor bin path | /usr/bin/supervisorctl |
| supervisor_user | The supervisor user | docker |
| supervisor_update_timeout | The supervisor update timeout to gracefully stop the process when a configuration change | 600 |
| execute_as_api | Enable the queue as API mode | false |
| api_url | URL to run the queue as API mode | http://127.0.0.1/queue/process |

### Showing all available jobs
```bash
$ php artisan queue-manager:show-jobs
```
### Getting error events
You need add to your AppServiceProvider and log as you like
```php
$this->app['events']->listen(\LaravelQueueManager\Events\ScheduleError::class, function(\LaravelQueueManager\Events\ScheduleError $scheduleError){
            
});
```

## Deploying

### Supervisor config
You need configure a cron to run as root every minute to generate the supervisor config

```bash
$ php artisan queue-manager:generate-config
```

### Scheduler
You need configure a cron to run every minute to generate the scheduler
```bash
$ php artisan schedule:run
```

### Queue Restart
Every time you change the PHP code, it's necessary to restart the queues. Put this at your deploy script.
```bash
$ php artisan queue:restart
```

## API Mode
### Introduction
To easily scale your jobs machine, you can run the queues in API mode. An API is much more easy to apply auto-scale.

### Configuration
In your route configuration file add:
```php
$api->post('queue/process', 'LaravelQueueManager\Http\Controllers\QueueController@process');
```

Edit in your "queue_manager.php" config file the execute_as_api and api_url options.
